# Mario X Flappy

<video controls src="demo.mp4" title="Title"></video>

My first attempt at making games. started off with Brackeys (YouTube) tutorial and made the mario-like game. Then added a couple of advanced things:
HUD, respawn to checkmark, going down the platform on down arrow, video player when user reaches the flag. Then as a practice, added the floppy bird -like game on top of that.
